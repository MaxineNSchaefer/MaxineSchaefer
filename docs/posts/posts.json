    "contents": "\r\nI recently attended a guided TidyTuesday hosted by RLadies Freiburg and wanted to apply what I had learned to a new data set. I went to the TidyTuesday Github repo. Once there I found the Video Games and Sliced dataset. This dataset looked interesting to me because (1) it was about gaming which is a topic often spoken about in my household, and (2) it was a relatively small dataset containing only seven variables.\r\nIn this post, I’ll first give a narrative summary of what I did. I include all the code and the final visualisation at the end of the post. You can find all the code at the TidyTuesday repo on Github.\r\nFirst, load packages with library(). I loaded {tidyverse} and {tidytuesdayR}. I downloaded the data from Github using {tidytuesdayR} as indicated in the repo that contains the data. I soon realised you cannot keep downloading the data from online so I saved the data to a .csv file.\r\nI next peaked at the data using View(). This function shows you the data in the dataviewer. However, one also needs to summarise the data to see what one is working with. I used skim() from {skimr} for this overview. I also noted the data type of each variable.\r\nI decided to focus on Dota 2 because this is a game my husband loves to play. I also wanted to look at the peak number of players per month and how this changed over a year. I decided on 2019 since it was the last ‘normal’ year, and because I remember having the chance to open some of the prizes in my husband’s Battle Pass before The International. For those who don’t know, The International is the main and largest competition of the Dota 2 season each year. Thus, for my visualisation I added some data on the start and end dates of TI, and included the value of the total prize pool.\r\nWhat did I find? Peak player numbers do go up during TI, but do not reach the peak number of players in March.\r\nPeak number (in thousands) of D0ta 2 players in 2019In keeping with the Dota 2 ‘feel’ I made the visualisation dark. I even asked my husband, Mark, for some tips to make it feel more like Dota 2. We ended up with red as the colour. I am not sure I am in love with it, but I’m still proud of my first TidyTuesday attempt.\r\nHere’s the code to make the plot.\r\n\r\n\r\n# libraries\r\nlibrary(tidytuesdayR) # only to initially download data\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(ggdark) # for dark minimal theme\r\n\r\n# Download and save data\r\ntuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2021-03-16')\r\ndat <- tuesdata$games\r\n\r\n# Check out the data\r\nView(dat)\r\nskimr::skim(dat)\r\n\r\n# TI start and end\r\nTIstart <- (7/30) + 7 # TI starts 7 of July, convert the 7th day into a decimal and add to 7th month\r\nTIend <- (26/30) + 8 # TI ends 26 Aug, convert the 26th day into a decimal and add to 8th month\r\n\r\n# Generate graph\r\n\r\np_final <- \r\n  \r\n  # get data ready\r\n dat %>% \r\n  \r\n  # filter data to include only Dota 2 for 2019\r\n  filter(gamename == \"Dota 2\", # keep only Dota 2\r\n         year == 2019) %>%     # keep only year 2019\r\n  \r\n  # make axis more readable\r\n  mutate(peak_in_thousands = round((peak/1000), 0 )) %>% # reduce numbers on the graph by dividing by 1000\r\n  \r\n  # convert months to numbers so that the months are listed in order in the graph\r\n  mutate(month = case_when(   \r\n    month == \"January\" ~ 1,\r\n    month == \"February\" ~ 2,\r\n    month == \"March\" ~ 3,\r\n    month == \"April\" ~ 4,\r\n    month == \"May\" ~ 5,\r\n    month == \"June\" ~ 6,\r\n    month == \"July\" ~ 7,\r\n    month == \"August\" ~ 8,\r\n    month == \"September\" ~ 9,\r\n    month == \"October\" ~ 10,\r\n    month == \"November\" ~ 11,\r\n    month == \"December\" ~ 12\r\n  )) %>% mutate(month = as.numeric(month)) %>%  # convert to numeric so that the months will be listed in order\r\n\r\n\r\n# base graph\r\n ggplot(aes(x = month, y = peak_in_thousands)) + \r\n  geom_point(shape = 17, size = 3) + # add points\r\n  geom_line(linetype = 5) + # add lines to join points\r\n  \r\n  # add labels\r\n  labs(x = \"Month in 2019\",  \r\n       y = \"Peak number of players in thousands\",\r\n       title = \"PEAK NUMBER OF DOTA 2 PLAYERS\",\r\n       subtitle = \"per month in 2019\", \r\n       caption = \"Data source: TidyTuesday 2021-03-16\r\n       @MaxineNSchaefer\") +\r\n  \r\n  # fix axis breaks and limits\r\n  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 12) + # have a break for each month\r\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1100), breaks = c(0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100)) + # start at 0\r\n  \r\n  # add start and end dates of The International which I got from https://liquipedia.net/dota2/The_International/2019#Viewership_Stats\r\n  geom_vline(xintercept = TIstart, color = \"#cc0000\") + # add start date and color using Dota 2 colour\r\n  geom_vline(xintercept = TIend, color = \"#cc0000\") + # add end date and color using Dota 2 colour\r\n  \r\n    # add label for TI, and prize pool\r\n  annotate(geom=\"text\", x=8, y=450, label=\"TI 9\", color=\"#cc0000\", size = 6) + # add text to graph \r\n  annotate(geom=\"text\", x=10, y=450, label= # add text to indicate prize pool value\r\n  \"Prize pool\r\n  34.33 mil USD\", color=\"#cc0000\", size = 4) +\r\n  \r\n  # edit theme\r\ndark_theme_minimal() + # add basic dark theme from {ggdark}\r\n  \r\n  # edit theme to match Dota 2 colours more or less\r\n  theme(axis.title = element_text(colour = \"#b22222\", face = \"bold\"),\r\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 20, colour = \"#cc0000\", face = \"bold\", family = \"serif\"), #change the font for the title\r\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = \"#cc0000\"),\r\n        plot.caption = element_text(colour = \"#b22222\"),\r\n        axis.text = element_text(colour = \"#b22222\"),\r\n        panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # remove grid lines\r\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())  # remove grid lines\r\n\r\np_final\r\n# ggsave(\"final_plot.png\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nHi!\r\nWelcome to my blog. I described this post as introducing myself.\r\nWho am I? In a bid to stop defining myself by my work, maybe I could say that I am a nature lover who does not get out nearly enough; I like to occupy my time learning new things, listening to audiobooks (I’m on an Enderverse binge at the moment), and looking after my indoor plants. If I did have to mention work, I’d say that I am a researcher and teacher. I’ve studied Linguistics, but my research currently fits more closely in the sub-discipline of Applied Linguistics.\r\nI am hoping that this website will be a place for me to keep a record of what I’ve done and what I’m interested in. After getting a little more used to R I wanted to see if I would be able to make a website (and keep it running). Since I’m always having to Google the same things when it comes to my own analysis, I hope to also set up some posts to remind myself how to do things. Maybe this could be useful to you too.\r\nAnyway, please get in touch if you’d like to say “hi!”. The relevant contacts are available on the home page.\r\nStaring ahead at the future of possibilities 📍 Hogsback, South Africa 📷 Mark Schaefer\r\n\r\n\r\n",
