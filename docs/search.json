In my PhD, which is a longitudinal project, I examine phonological processing skills and how they support literacy in children’s first and additional language. I have also worked on the Early Grade Reading Studies in South Africa.\r\n              In these roles, I have developed my research and project management skills, and have also created language and literacy tests for under-researched languages such as isiXhosa and isiZulu. In the last year I have been working on developing my data wrangling and analysis skills in R, and have recently converted to an open science enthusiast. I also have experience as a lecturer at tertiary level.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              I am a researcher hoping to better understand how to support literacy acquisition and development.
